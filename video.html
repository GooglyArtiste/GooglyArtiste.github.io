<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/294178970">Abstract Bokeh Pan</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user90243073">Lesley Gallinat</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>When I created this work, I didn't really have a concept in mind. I was
  focused primarily on learning the ins and outs of using Adobe Premiere Pro and
  experimenting with transitions. If I had to sum up the theme of this piece,
  I would have to say it is about Woman Empowerment. Interpretation is at the
  viewer's own discretion.</p>
