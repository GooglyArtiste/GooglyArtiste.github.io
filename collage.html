<p>My piece is an exercise in Absurdism and the frustration when reaching the
   paradoxical conclusion of it. Absurdism is a study of throught which focuses
   on the conflict humans face when trying to find meaning in something where
    there is no meaning at all. An excellent example of this is the kids' TV
    series Spongebob Squarepants. The show is set in the ocean under water, yet
     the characters often do actions that are physically impossible, such as
     starting fires, operating electrical equipment without getting fatally
      shocked, using plumbing like faucets and toilets, even flooding.
None of this is possible in the real world, yet it does not detract from the
 quality of the humor. Seems the only way to enjoy the show is to simply turn
 off your brain and just go with the flow, much like most of us do when watching
  TV in general.</p>
